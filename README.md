# Tic Tac Toe
## What I found easier
Creating functions for checking wins & preventing overwriting filled cells.

Creating a loop function which integrates all necessary steps when player clicks a cell, such as:
1. Checking if cell is filled & preventing overwrite
2. Checking if someone has already won the round and stopping players from further changing empty cells.
3. Determining which player's turn it is and updating the array to reflect cell change.
4. Adding the correct player symbol on correct cell on the webpage.
5. Running the winner check function.

## What I found trickier
* Associating clicked columns in html with a nested array in Javascript. (Had to Google it.)
* Function that elegantly checks win states.

## Known errors/limits
Does not check for ties.
No reset button.
